# 42_libft_extra

## Description

This project extends the functionality of the 42 School's libft by adding new custom functions. The original `libft` provides a collection of C functions for common tasks, and `lift_extra` builds upon this foundation to offer additional features.

The "pure" `libft` project can be found here:
