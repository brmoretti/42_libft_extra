# 42_libft_extra

## Description

This project extends the functionality of the 42 School's libft by adding new custom functions. The original `libft` provides a collection of C functions for common tasks, and `lift_extra` builds upon this foundation to offer additional functions.

The implementation of the equivalent bonus part is entire different, since I preffered to use a different structure for linked lists. In this case there is a struct for the list which contains pointers to the first and the last elements. This implementation is very useful to improve drastically the performance of algorithms like ft_lstaddback. The complexity drops from O(n) to O(1).

# 42_libft_extra

## Description

**42_libft_extra** is an extension of the original 42 School's libft, enhancing its functionality by introducing additional custom functions. While the core `libft` provides a comprehensive set of C functions for common tasks, `libft_extra` goes beyond, offering a supplementary collection of functions to address diverse programming needs.

### Unique Features

One distinguishing feature of **libft_extra** is the reimagined implementation of the bonus part, where a different structure for linked lists has been adopted. Specifically, a struct for the list is introduced, incorporating pointers to both the first and last elements. This novel approach significantly enhances the performance of algorithms such as `ft_lstaddback`, reducing the complexity from O(n) to O(1). This optimized structure is designed to expedite list operations, making it particularly advantageous for scenarios involving frequent additions to the end of the list.
